title: Welcome to NMA3012 | Programming Interactivity 
---

<div>
    <h3>Course Description, goals and objectives</h3>
    <p>User input can affect a wide range of new media artworks that may include animation, sound, web projects, and robotics. In this hands-on introduction, students will learn techniques for harnessing analog and digital inputs to create responsive, interactive artworks. Students will explore functional, ethical, and aesthetic frameworks for interactivity; develop skills to conceptualize, code, and craft their own interactive projects; and discover how to apply digital interactivity in engaging, participatory artworks. Through projects, experiments, lectures, readings, and field trips, this course introduces New Media Arts students to programming and microcontrollers; no previous programming experience is necessary. Prerequisite: NMA 2050, Introduction to New Media Arts.</p>

    <h3>Textbooks</h3>
    <p>The main textbook for this class is <a href="http://media.espora.org/mgoblin_media/media_entries/407/Learning_Processing_-_A_Beginners_Guide_to_Programming_Images_Animation_and_Interaction_--_Daniel_Shiffman.pdf">Learning Processing.</a> Students with previous coding background are encouraged to read his more advanced series, <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a>by Daniel Shiffman.</p> <p>Excerpts from the book Multimedia - From Wagner to Virtual Reality will be assigned as reading assignments, and serve as reference for in-class discussions on the following week.</p>

    <h3>Instructor Contact</h3>
    <p>Feel free to email me at <strong>z@zzyw.media</strong> any time for questions. Please write <strong>NMA3012</strong> on the title of the email.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Participation in class is required.  Irregular attendance not only hurts a student's course work, but it weakens the class as a whole and is not permitted.  Since this course has frequent in-class coding excercise, missing class will also affect your progress in the course. Attendance is recorded prior to every lecture, and students with excessive absences will be officially dropped from the course in accordance with College rules.
<br>Arriving late interferes with other students' learning and is not acceptable. Repeated Late attendance will be counted absent.
    <br>All cellphones and other electronic devices should be turned off att all times during lecture.</p>

<div>
    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <p>A coding assigment will be assigned after each lecture and collected at the begining of the following lecture. All students are requried to present their assigments to the rest of the class, articulating the conceptual, asthetic as well as technical aspect of the assignment.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Midterm and Final Projects</h3>
    <p>There will be a screen-based midterm project and a live-performance based final project assignment for this class. Students are highly encouraged to work in groups of 2 or 3. In-class discussions sessions as well as individual group meetings will be held to help conceptualize the midterm project idea. A written final project proposal will be assigned to help students draft ideas, gather visual and technical reference.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Grades</h3>
    <p>Final grades will be calculated according to the following formula:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attendance and Class participation: 20%</li>
        <li>Homework: and in-class activities: 50%</li>
        <li>Mid-term exam: 15%</li>
        <li>Fina exam: 15%</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Weekly class schedule</h3>
    <p>Depending on the progress of the class, the weekly assigment is subject to change. I will send email as well as post more detailed assignment requirement after each week's lesson.</p>
