<h5>Attendance</h5>
<p>Participation in class is required.  Irregular attendance not only hurts a student's course work, but it weakens the class as a whole and is not permitted.  Since this course has frequent in-class coding excercise, missing class will also affect your progress in the course.  AÂ person not actively participating in the course for whatever reason does not deserve to get credit for it.  Attendance is recorded every day, and students with excessive absences will be officially dropped from the course in accordance with College rules.
<br><br>Freshmen and sophomores (fewer than 61 credits completed) will be dropped if more than four classes are missed.  Juniors and seniors (over 60 credits) will be dropped after six missed classes.
Note that even absences for medical, religious, or family reasons or for subway delays are counted against your allowed limit of four (or six) classes missed.  There are no make-ups for in-class exercises for any reason. 
<br><br>Arriving late interferes with other students' learning and is not acceptable.  Subway delays and other problems are unavoidable on occasion, but it is each student's responsibility to plan carefully to arrive on time and well prepared.  Late students may be counted absent.</p>
