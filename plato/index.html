    <h2>Republic By Plato</h2>

<div class="row">
    <h4>background Knowledge</h4>
    <p>Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire œuvre is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes Plato as "...one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the history of philosophy. ... He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word “philosopher” should be applied. But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him), Aquinas and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank." </p>

    <div>
        <h4>Part One: Shadow Puppetry Experiment</h4>
        <p>Prepare flashlight, and objects of various qualities. Such as toilet paper,  packets of seed, glass cup, metal cup, lofa, etc. </p>
        <p>Use a flashlight to perform a shaddow puppitry to recreate the Allegory of Cave.</p>
        <p>Ask students to face against flashlight and describe the shadows they see. </p>
        <p>Ask students to turn around and look at the flashlight shining on the objects still in the darkness</p>
        <p>Turn on the light in the classroom and reveal the entire setting and all the objects all at once. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Part Two: Discussion</h4>
        <p>The symbolic meaning of the objects, and their application in our world today. What does the darkness, the shadow, the flashlight(fire), the light, and the objects mean in real life? </p>
        <p>Plato's view on the relationship between sight and mind? Senses and logic?</p>
        <p>Education's role to inspire curiosity, enquiry, and critical thinking.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Part Three: Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Education moves the philosopher from the stage of imagination to the stage of thohught, while attaining higher order of intellect, and ultimately brings him to the Form of the Good.</p>
        <p>Education should aim at turning the soul toward right desires. Continuing the analogy between mind and sight, Socrates explains that the vision of a clever, wicked man might be just as sharp as that of a philosopher. The problem lies in what he turns his sharp vision toward.</p>

    <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
    <h4>Cave Allegory</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <p>Stage of imagination versus stage of thought</p>
        <p>Human beings living in a underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.They can see nothing but the shadows of the images. These prisoners represent the lowest stage on the line —imagination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p>Stage of thought</p>
        <p>once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until he ‘s forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities</p>
        <p>Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.</p>
        <p>And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.</p>

    <h4>Virtual</h4>
    <p>And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Service</h4>
    <p>Kings must Ascend to goodness, and go down to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not. the intention of the legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.</p>

<div>
    <h4>Senses and Intect</h4>
    <p>A little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.</p>
    <p>Discrapencies on perceiving the senses, such as size and softness, naturally summons calculation and intellegence.</p>
    <p>Inquires into the descrpencies arouses the distinction between the visible and the intellegible.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Inspiration</h4>
    <p>But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an image) this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described.</p>

<div>
    <h4>Dialectic</h4>
    <p>The skill to ask and answer questions, and enquire about assumptions</p>
    <p>Learning it too early run the risk of arguing for amusement, refuting as imitation, and speedily rejecting all of their prior believes. </p>
