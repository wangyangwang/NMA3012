<!--<h1>Final Checklist</h1>-->
<ol>
    <h3>For final, you will be required to present three code-based animation sketches in a single website. The requirements are the following:</h3>
    <li>At least one sketch should be partially influenced by mouse on a real time basis. Some examples are, live drawing, mouseClick giving birth to object, mouseMove triggering objects to jitter or shift or change color/opacity.</li>
    <li>At least one sketch should be object-oriented, meaning there is an object class, based on which object is being declared and initiated.</li>
    <li>At least one sketch should have an object array, with objects stored inside. And a draw loop calling each object to perform various tasks.</li>
    <li>I strongly encourage you to keep building off of the existing midterm project. You will very likely to have better results and a more fully developed theme.</li>
    <li>Working in group of two is allowed, and very much encouraged. If you do so, tell me at least a week beforehand. Both of you will receive the same grade for the final project regardless of division of labor.  </li>
    <li>On May 18th, you will be continuing the same presentation format used during midterm. Be respectiful of your fellow presenters. Absolutely no electronic devices allowed during the entire presentation.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h3>Presentation guideline revisited:</h3>
    <li>What story are you telling?</li>
    <li>How you want your audience to feel?</li>
    <li>What's the inspiration? Show image or short video if you have them.</li>
    <li>Now, take the audience through each sketch you made. Code logic, structure, usage of color, image, video if any. And be prepared to explain how the code functions.</li>
</ol>
