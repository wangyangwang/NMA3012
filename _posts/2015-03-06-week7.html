    <h2>Image Processing - Pixel Blending</h2>

<div>
    <h2>Setting Pixels according to their 2D locations</h2>
    <p>Let's consider this example below</p>
        <div class="row">    
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img src="{{ '/img/week7/circles.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
        </div>
    <p>First we ask: which row is our target pixel on ==>row 2</p>
    <p>Then we ask: which column is our target pixel on ==>column 3</p>
    <p>Since there has been 2-1 entire rows of pixels with 3-1 individual pixels ahead of this one, its location in our pixel array should be:
        <br><br>loc = 1*4+2 = 6 or</p>
        <br><br>loc = y*width+x
    
    
    {% highlight js %} 
    size(400, 200);
loadPixels();

  //first ask: which row is our pixel on
  for (int y = 0; y < height; y++ ) {
    //then ask: which column is our pixel on
    for (int x = 0; x < width; x++ ) {
     //there has been y entire rows of pixels with x individual pixels ahead of this one, so its location in our pixel array should be
    int loc = y*width+x; 
      if (x % 2 == 0) { // If we are an even column
      pixels[loc] = color(255);
    } else { // If we are an odd column
      pixels[loc] = color(0); //   We use the column number (x) to determine whether the color should be black or white.
    }
  }
}

updatePixels();
