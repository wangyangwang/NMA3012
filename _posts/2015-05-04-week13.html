    <h2>Interaction Design workshop - Face Detection</h2>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Last week, we talked about Facetracking algorithm's creative adaptation. This week, we will develop a project using CLM face tracking addon for openFrameworks based on Jason Saragih's <a href="http://facetracker.net/">FaceTracker</a> algorithm. Jason Saragih graduated with a PhD in computer science at National Australian University in 2004. Viola Johns algorithm was Jason's graduation thesis, which he developed further while working as a HCI researcher at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Jason is currently a research scientist at Oculus, focusing on application of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to the specific problem of biometric learning. At the front end, this involves the learning, detection and registration of nonrigid objects, in particular the human face. He is also interested in the utility of features extracted from this process for recognition tasks, in particular that of affect and identity, geared towards Human Computer Interaction. 
        <br>The OpenFrameworks application that we will use today is further developed by NYU adjunct professor Kyle McDonald, who contributes frequently to creative applications related to computer vision and interaction.
